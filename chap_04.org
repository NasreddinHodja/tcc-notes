#+title: Chap. 4: Window Attributes

+ Control a window's:
  - background
  - border
  - patter
  - color
  - events that should be queued for it
  - etc.

+ Setting windows attributes is necessary when you use =XCreateWindow()= instead of =XCreateSimpleWindow()=.
  - However, *it's not necessary that you set any window attributes other than the window background and border*. This chapter is mainly about optional features that you may find useful.

* Setting Window Attributes [4.1]
+ Can be set while creating a window with =XCreateWindow()= or afterwerd witha  call to =XChangeWindowAttributes()=.
+ When creating a window with =XCreateSimpleWindow()=, most of the attributes are inherited from the parent.
+ There are also several routines for changin individual window attributes, including the =event_mask=, background and border.

+ To set with =XCreateWindow()= or =XChangeWindowAttributes()=, you set the members of an =XSetWindowAttributes= structure to the desired values, create a mask indicating which members you have set, and call the routine.

* The Window Attribute Structure [4.2]
There are 2 structures associated with window attributes.
+ =XWindowAttributes= is a read-only structure that contains all the attributes.
+ =XSetWindowAttributes= is a structure that contains only those attributes that a program is allowed to set.

#+name: Example 4-1. The XSetWindowAttributes structure
#+begin_src c
typedef struct _XSetWindowAttributes {
   Pixmap background_pixmap;    /* Pixmap, None, or ParentRelative */
   long background_pixel;       /* Background pixel value */
   Pixmap border_pixmap;        /* Pixmap, None, or CopyFromParent */
   int bit_gravity;             /* One of the bit gravity symbols */
   int win_gravity;             /* One of the window gravity symbols */
   int backing_store;           /* NotUseful, WhenMapped, or Always */
   long backing_bitplanes;      /* Planes to be preserved, if possible */
   long backing_pixel;          /* Value to use in restoring planes */
   Bool save_under;             /* Should bits under window be saved */
   long event_mask;             /* Events that should be queued */
   long do_not_propagate_mask;  /* Events that shouldn’t propagate */
   Bool override_redirect;      /* Override redirected configuration
                                ,* requests */
   Colormap colormap;           /* Colormap associated with window */
   Cursor cursor;               /* Cursor to be displayed or None */
} XSetWindowAttributes;
#+end_src

+ After setting the elements of the =XSetWindowAttributes= to the desired values, you have to set the =valuemask= argument that represent which members are to be changed in the server's internal structure.
  - A symbol (begining with =CW=) are to be combined with the bitwise OR operator.

#+name: Table 4-1 Window Attribute Mask Symbols
| Member                | Flag               | bit |
|-----------------------+--------------------+-----|
| background_pixmap     | CWBackPixmap       |   0 |
| background_pixel      | CWBackPixel        |   1 |
| border_pixmap         | CWBorderPixmap     |   2 |
| border_pixel          | CWBorderPixel      |   3 |
| bit_gravity           | CWBitGravity       |   4 |
| win_gravity           | CWWinGravity       |   5 |
| backing_store         | CWBackingStore     |   6 |
| backing_planes        | CWBackingPlanes    |   7 |
| backing_pixel         | CWBackingPixel     |   8 |
| override_redirect     | CWOverrideRedirect |   9 |
| save_under            | CWSaveUnder        |  10 |
| event_mask            | CWEventMask        |  11 |
| do_not_propagate_mask | CWDontPropagate    |  12 |
| colormap              | CWColormap         |  13 |
| cursor                | CWCursor           |  14 |

Example: you want to set initial values of the background and border pixel values, you would follow the procedure:

#+name: Example 4-2. Setting window attributes while creating a window
#+begin_src c
Display *display;
Window parent, window;
int x, y;
unsigned int width, height, border_width;
int depth;
int screen_num;
Visual *visual;
unsigned int class;
XSetWindowAttributes setwinattr;
unsigned long valuemask;
/* (Must open display) */
screen_num = DefaultScreen(display);
valuemask = CWBackPixel | CWBorderPixel;
setwinattr.background_pixel = WhitePixel(display, screen_num);
setwinattr.border_pixel = BlackPixel(display, screen_num);
window = XCreateWindow(display, parent, x, y, width, height,
   border_width, depth, class, visual, valuemask, &setwinattr);
#+end_src

If the window already exists, you follow the procedure:

#+name: Example 4-3. Changing window attributes of existing window
#+begin_src c
Display *display;
Window window;
XSetWindowAttributes setwinattr;
unsigned long valuemask;
/* (Must open display, create window) */
valuemask = CWBackPixel | CWBorderPixel;
setwinattr.background_pixel = WhitePixel(display, screen_num);
setwinattr.border_pixel = BlackPixel(display, screen_num);
XChangeWindowAttributes(display, window, valuemask, &setwinattr);
#+end_src

+ Some attributes have specifig routines for setting them:

#+name: Table 4-2 Attributes that can be set individually
| Attribute         | Routine                      |
|-------------------+------------------------------|
| background_pixmap | XSetWindowBackgroundPixmap() |
| background_pixel  | XSetWindowBackgroundPixel()  |
| border_pixmap     | XSetWindowBorderPixmap()     |
| border_pixel      | XSetWindowBorderPixel()      |

* Settable Attributes [4.3]
+ One group controls the appearance of a window.
  - =background_pixel=
  - =background_pixmap=
  - =bordel_pixel=
  - =border_pixmap=
  - =cursor=
+ most clients will set the border, background, and cursor but use the default colormap

+ Another group is provided to allow clients to improme their drawing performance under certain conditions.
  - =backing_pixel=
  - =backing_planes=
  - =backing_store=
  - =bit_gravity=
  - =save_under=
+ These do not affect the appearance or operation of a client.
+ It is advisable to consider =bit_gravity= when designing a client, but this can be considered after the client's funcionality is complete.

+ The =event_mask= and =do_not_propagate_mask= attributes control the selection and propagation of events.

+ The =win_gravity= attribute provides a means for relocating a window automatically when its parent is resized.
  - Simplifies the code for repositioning subwindows when they are resized.

+ The =override_redirect= attribute controls whether requests for map or reconfigure the window can be intercepted by the WM.
  - Mean to be set for most temporary types of windows such as pop-up menus.
  - In practice, only affects the children of the root window.

+ The class (=InputOutput= or =InputOnly=) can be specified in the call to =XCreateWindow()=, or is =InputOutput= if created with =XCreateSimpleWindow()=.
+ =InputOnly= windows have only the following subset of attributes:
  - =win_gravity=
  - =event_mask=
  - =do_not_propagate_mask=
  - =override_redirect=
  - =cursor=

** The Window Background [4.3.1]
+ It's the drawing surface on which other graphics are drawn.
  - Solid color or patterned with a pixmap.
  - Users expect to be able to specify the background color on the command line or in the resource database.
  - If a pixmap is used, you should create a pixmap with 2 colors specified by the user.

+ 2 attributes that control the background are
  - =background_pixmap=, set by =XSetWindowBackgroundPixmap()=
  - =background_pixel=, set by =XSetWindowBackground()=
+ Each one can take preference over the other, the winner being the one that is set last. If both are set in the same call to =XCreateWindow()= or =XChangeWindowAttributes()=, the =background_pixel= value is used.

+ Background of exposed aread of windows is automatically drawn by the server, *regardless of whether the app selects =Expose= events.*
+ However, changes in background attributes will not take effect until the server generates the next =Expose= event on that window.
  - To make the change instant, call =XClearWindow()= and flush the request buffer with =XFlush()=.

*** =background_pixmap= [4.3.1.1]
*see book*

*** =background_pixel= [4.3.1.2]
*see book*

** The Window Border [4.3.2]
+ Like window background, can be solid color or tiled with a pixmap.
+ Changes to border attributes are reflected immediately, no need to flush request buffer or call =XClearWindow()=.

+ 2 attributes that control the window border are
  - =border_pixmap=, set by =XSetWindowBorderPixmap()=
  - =border_pixel=, set by =XSetWindowBorder()=
+ Precedence works the same as background.

*** =border_pixmap= [4.3.1.1]
*see book*

*** =border_pixel= [4.3.1.2]
*see book*

** Bit Gravity [4.3.3]
+ =bit_gravity= tells the server where to put the existing bits in the larger or smaller window.
  - Allows some clients (not all can take advantage of this) to avoid redrawing parts of their windows.
+ Is never necessary.
  - Is used to improve performance in some cases.

+ =bit_gravity= has 11 possible values:
  - =ForgetGravity= (default) specifies that window contents should always be discarded after a size change.
  - =StaticGravity= specifies that window contents should not move relative to the origin of the root window.
+ Each constant below specifies where the old window contents should be placed in the resized window:
  - =NorthWestGravity=
  - =NorthGravity=
  - =NorthEastGravity=
  - =WestGravity=
  - =CenterGravity=
  - =EastGravity=
  - =SouthWestGravity=
  - =SouthGravity=
  - =SouthEastGravity=
[[./imgs/fig4_1.png]]
+ When an =Expose= event arrives, the app need only redraw the new blank spaces.
  - No =Expose= event will be generated on the area that was saved because of =bit_gravity=

** Window Gravity [4.3.4]
+ =win_gravity= controls the repositioning of subwindows when a parent window is resized.
+ Same shit but for subwindows.

** Backing Store [4.3.5]
+ The _backing store_ automatically maintains the contents of a window while it is obscured or even while it is unmapped.
  - Like having a copy of the window saved in a pixmap, automatically copied to the screen whenever necessary to keep the visible contents up to date.
+ Not available in some servers.

+ A client might use this feature to back up a window the client is incapable of redrawing for some reason or to be able to draw into a window that is obscured or unmapped.

** Saving Under [4.3.6]
+ The =save_under= attribute controls whether the contents of the screen beneath a window should be preserved just before the window is mapped and replaced just after it is unmapped.
  - Most useful for pop-up windows, which need to be on screen only briefly.
  - No =Expose= events will be sent to the windows that are exposed when the pop-up window is unmapped, saving the time necessary to redraw their contents.

+ *Different from =backing_store= because: =save_under= may save portions of several windows beneath a window for the duration of the appearance of the window on the screen, while backing store saves the contents of a single window while it is mapped or even unmapped, depending on the attributes.*

** Event Handling [4.3.7]
+ =event_mask= and =do_not_propagate_mask= attributes control the propagation of events through the window hierarchy.
+ More info on events in Chap. 8.

** Substructure Redirect Override [4.3.8]
+ _substructure redirect_ allows a WM to intercept any requests to map, move, resize or change the border width of windows.
  - The WM can then modify these requests if necessary, to ensure that they meet its window layout policy.
+ setting =override_redirect= to =True= for a window allows a window to be mapped, moved, resized, or its border width changed without the intervention of the WM.
  - Usually done for menus that are frequently mapped and almost ummediately unmapped again.

** Colormap [4.3.9]
+ =colormap= attribute specifies which colormap should be used to interpret the pixel values in a window.
+ For majority of clients that do not have without special color needs, this attribute can be left in its default state.
** Cursor [4.3.10]
+ It's the object that tracks the pointer on the screen.
+ In X, a _cursor_ is a server resource which defines a cursor pattern, its colors, and the point within the pattern that will be reported in events (called the _hotspot_).

** Default Attributes [4.3.11]
+ see table 4-3 summarizing the default attributes for an =InputOutput= window.

* Information from the XWindowAttributes Structure [4.4]
+ Many window characteristics described in Chap. 2, including window configuration, are also stored with the window attributes by the server but are not *programmable* by using =XChangeWindowAttributes()=.

#+name: Example 4-4. Read-only XWindowAttributes members
#+begin_src c
typedef struct {
    /* Members writable with XChangeWindowAttributes omitted */
   .
   .
   .
    /* Window geometry −− set by window configuration functions
     ,* in cooperation with window manager */
    int x, y;             /* Location of window */
    int width, height;    /* Width and height of window */
    int border_width;     /* Border width of window */
    /* This is the event_mask attribute set by XSelectInput */
    long your_event_mask; /* My event mask */
    /* Set when the window is created, not changeable */
    Visual *visual;       /* The associated visual structure */
    int class;            /* InputOutput, InputOnly */
    int depth;            /* Depth of window */
    Screen *screen;       /* Pointer to screen the window is on */
    /* Server sets these members */
    Window root;          /* Root of screen containing window */
    Bool map_installed;   /* Is colormap currently installed */
    int map_state;        /* IsUnmapped, IsUnviewable, or
                          ,* IsViewable */
    long all_event_masks; /* Events all clients have interest in */
} XWindowAttributes;
